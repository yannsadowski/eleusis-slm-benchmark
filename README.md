# Eleusis SLM Benchmark

Fork of [Eleusis LLM Benchmarck](https://github.com/scienceetonnante/eleusis-llm-benchmark)

A benchmark for evaluating Small Language Models on **inductive reasoning and pattern discovery**, using an adaptation of Robert Abbott's card game [Eleusis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_(card_game)) (1956).

A secret rule determines which cards are accepted. The model must discover the rule by playing cards and observing the outcomes, mimicking the process of scientific hypothesis testing.


## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv sync

# Set up API keys (only the providers you need)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys

# Run evaluation with a model
uv run python scripts/evaluate_single.py --model "kimi-k2"

# Run parallel evaluation across models
./scripts/run_parallel_eval.sh eval_models.txt
```

## How It Works

Each evaluation round plays out as follows:

1. A **secret rule** is loaded (a Python function that accepts or rejects cards based on their properties and the sequence of previously played cards)
2. The model receives a hand of 12 cards and sees a starter card on the table
3. Each turn, the model **plays a card** and observes if it's accepted (mainline) or rejected (sideline)
4. The model can **guess the rule** at any point, at the cost of a penalty for wrong guesses
5. The round ends when the model guesses correctly or reaches the turn limit

**Scoring:** `max_turns - turn_used - (penalty × wrong_guesses)` for a correct guess. Higher is better, score is floored at 0.

## Running Evaluations

### Single Model


| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--model MODEL` | Model key from `models.yaml` (required unless `--resume`) |
| `--num-rules N` | Number of distinct rules to test (default: all) |
| `--rule-index N` | Starting rule index |
| `--max-turns N` | Max turns per round (default: 30) |
| `--tag TAG` | Tag appended to output folder name |
| `--resume PATH` | Resume from checkpoint folder |
| `--config FILE` | Config file path (default: `config.yaml`) |

### Multiple Models in Parallel

```bash
# Provide a file listing model keys (one per line)
./scripts/run_parallel_eval.sh eval_models.txt

# With a custom config
./scripts/run_parallel_eval.sh eval_models.txt custom_config.yaml
```

The models file contains one model key per line (lines starting with `#` are ignored).

### Analyzing Results

```bash
uv run python scripts/analyze_results.py results/<folder>
```

Generates charts and tables saved in the input folder: basic metrics comparison, complexity analysis, per-model reports, token usage, and more.

## Configuration

### `models.yaml` — Model Definitions

Each entry defines a model with its provider and provider-specific settings:

```yaml
# Closed-source providers
claude-opus-4.5:
  provider: anthropic
  model_id: claude-opus-4-5-20251101
  reasoning_budget: 16000

gpt-5.2-medium:
  provider: openai
  model_id: gpt-5.2
  reasoning_effort: medium    # none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh

gemini-3-pro-preview-high:
  provider: google
  model_id: gemini-3-pro-preview
  thinking_level: high        # low|high

grok-4:
  provider: xai
  model_id: grok-4

# Open models via HuggingFace Inference Providers
deepseek-r1:
  provider: huggingface
  model_id: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
  hf_provider: together
  reasoning_format: think_tags  # think_tags|separate_field
```

Supported providers: `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `xai`, `huggingface`.

### `config.yaml` — Game Settings

```yaml
game:
  num_rules: 0              # 0 = use entire rule library
  num_rounds_per_rule: 3
  max_turns: 30
  hand_size: 12
  wrong_guess_penalty: 2
  seed: 42

rules:
  library_path: "rules.json"
  selection: "sequential"

llm:
  max_tokens: 16384
  max_llm_retries: 3
  temperature: 0.7
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the API keys for the providers you use:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
XAI_API_KEY=...
HF_TOKEN=...
```

## Rule Library

Rules are written in natural language in `rules.txt` and compiled to executable Python via an LLM:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_rule_library.py --input rules.txt --output rules.json
```

Each compiled rule is a Python function body with access to `card` (current card) and `mainline` (list of previously accepted cards). Card properties: `card.rank` (1–13), `card.color` (`"red"` or `"black"`), `card.suit.suit_name` (`"hearts"`, `"diamonds"`, `"clubs"`, `"spades"`).

The game uses a double deck (104 cards).
